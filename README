SWH LV2 plugins

http://plugin.org.uk/

LICENCE

This plugins are licensed under the GNU GPL version 3. See the file COPYING for details.

STATUS

This is an early experimental port of my LADSPA plugins to the LV2
specification, c.f. http://lv2plug.in/ . It's still quite early days, but most
things should work as well or not as they did in LADSPA.

BUILD

Linux / OSX: run "make"
Windows: run "make real-clean all" (untested, might wrk, might not)

INSTALL

run "make install-system" if you want the plugins installed globally, requires
root privileges, or "make install-user" if you want them just installed for
the current user.

BUG REPORTS

Please report bugs to Steve Harris at steve at plugin.org.uk.

EDITING

If you wish to edit the source code (.xml files in the subdirectories of the
plugin directory) then you will need xsltproc installed. It's in the libxslt
package, which is part of gnome, I think. Do not edit the .c files, and do not
send patches against the .c files.
